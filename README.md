## Introduction

My name is Brett Chalupa, and I am a developer at Gristmill.

I've used Git everyday for the past 18 months, and it wasn't until about 6 months ago when I finally "got it".

I hope I am able to help you "get it" much faster than it took me because I think it is one of the most important tools a developer has.
